# Insipid-wip
(will be) a simple calendar that reads json files

## Goals
- runs in browser in a local setting
- ability to chain imports of multiple files to separate contexts (work-calendar.json, school-calendar.txt)
- ability to edit files by writing memos for each date with the html interface
- ability to export files for reuse

## Todo
- write logic to store objects (a memo, a date) for each textarea
- concatenate multiple json imports into a single variable somehow
- implement json exporting via plaintext copy/paste or with a file download
